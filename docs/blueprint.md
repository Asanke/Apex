## Core Features:

- Circle Management: Create and manage isolated workspaces (Circles) for different business ventures and personal responsibilities.
- AI-Powered Task Assignment: Automatically assign tasks to the best-suited user based on their AI profile and the task description, with an Admin override option. Gemini API analyzes task requirements and user expertise to make informed suggestions.
- Focus Inbox: An AI-powered inbox that prioritizes items requiring immediate Admin attention, such as pending approvals, change requests, and AI-identified bottlenecks.
- AI-Validated Rejection: Ensure valid task rejection reasons by using Gemini to analyze and validate user-provided explanations, reducing misalignment and improving accountability. Displays feedback generated using the tool for insufficient reasons.
- Admin Override with Learning: Allow the Admin to override AI suggestions with a mandatory reason, which is then used to update the AI profile and improve future task assignments. Use Override codes that expire and are logged.
- Presence and Alert Monitoring: Monitor user presence and send alerts for pending tasks. Escalate to the Admin if a user is unresponsive after multiple attempts, ensuring critical tasks are not missed.
- User Roles and Permissions: Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions within each Circle, ensuring data isolation and security.
